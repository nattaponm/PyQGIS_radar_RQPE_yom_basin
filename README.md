# PyQGIS_radar_RQPE_yom_basin
PyQGIS codes are developed to create mosaicked RQPE for Yom River Basin in Thailand 
We developed python codes in PyQGIS for research entitled “Investigation of Z-R relationships during tropical storm in GIS using implemented mosaicking algorithms of radar rainfall estimates from ground-based weather radar in the Yom River basin, Thailand” submitted to Scientific journal entitled “Applied Geomatics ”. These all codes are freely to use, modify, distribute, develop as far as it is related to academic and research. Please recognize our paper as mention above when you use these codes. In the folders, there are four folders to store both developed codes in PyQGIS and data used, which are radar and gauge, in the research.
1codes: This folder contains the developed codes use in PyQGIS. 
1radar_CRI_data&1radar_PHS_data: This folder contains all radar data for both Chiangrai and Phitsanulok provinces used in associated with the codes
1shapefile_data: This folder contains boundary shapefiles, gauge stations, radar stations.
